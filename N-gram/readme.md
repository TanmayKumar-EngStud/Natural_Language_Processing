this folder consists of a python code for a bigram program that i made for understanding the concept of N-gram
for simplicity i made just for bi-gram

though there is a bit problem in my code it is taking an empty list in the next instance, i am not able to undestand that why it is happening but slowly with time
i will make changes and the code will run promisingly

this time it is just making the matching matrix but after fixing the error i will add the statement generator too...
